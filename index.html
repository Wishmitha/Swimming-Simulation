<p><strong>CS2012 : Principles of Object Oriented Programming – Semester Project – Final Report</strong></p>

<p><strong>Uses of fundamental OOP Principles :</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Inheritance :</strong>
Inheritance allows the subclasses inherit all the attributes and methods of their superclass. As clearly
displayed in the UML diagram, inheritance was used in several occasions in this project. All the
human related classes such as Swimmer, Judge, Spectator, \Inheritance allows the subclasses inherit
all the attributes and methods of their superclass. As clearly displayed in the UML diagram,
inheritance was used in several occasions in this project. All the human related classes such as
Swimmer, Judge, Spectator, SupportStaff etc. inherits from Person super class. And MaleSwimmer
and FemaleSwimmer classes inherits from abstract Swimmer class. So, this concept is useful in code
redundancy and extending the reusability.</p>

<p><strong>2. Abstraction :</strong>
Abstraction concept is referred to ignoring irrelevant aspects and focusing of reflecting aspects of an
object. This concept is useful in handling the complexity of the project. Couple of abstract classes
such as Person and Swimmer were used in this project. Even though these classes cannot be
instantiated, they minimizes the complexity by holding attributes and methods of their subclasses.
The abstract methods such as doBackStroke(), doBreastStroke() etc in Swimmer class are useful in
implementing (overriding) each method slightly differently in MaleSwimmer and FemaleSwimmer
classes. (Line – 115,116,117,118 in Swimmer Class)</p>

<p><strong>3. Polymorphism :</strong>
The ability of an object to take many forms is called as polymorphism. Polymorphism was mainly
used Swimmer type ArrayLists (ArrayList) which can store objects of both
MaleSwimmer and FemaleSwimmer types. (Line – 13,14 in PeopleTrack Class) This reduces the
complexity of the project by giving a more generic type to store different types of objects. The sameconcept was used in method load in SaveLoadData class where a ArrayList of type Person
(ArrayList) was declared to store different types of objects (Swimmers, Judges etc.)
(Line – 26 in SaveLoadData Class) In ThreadMovement class the ArrayList results of type
Swimmer is used to store both male and female swimmers. (Line - 28 in ThreadMovement Class)</p>

<p><strong>4. Encapsulation :</strong>
Encapsulation is referred to hiding of implemented attribute in order to maintain the security of the
code. This concept was used in this project to hide the most important attributes such as ArrayLists
which keeps track on people in PeopleTrack class. (Line – 13,14,15,16 in PeopleTrack Class) These
ArrayLists were declared private, therefore they cannot be accessed or edited from a outside class.
These lists were maintained by using setter and getter methods. Other than this, in almost all the
classes, the encapsulation is maintained by declaring attributes private and implementing setters and
getters.</p>

<p><strong>Concurrency Control</strong></p>

<p>The movement of the each swimmer is configured by a thread which is implemented in
ThreadMovement Class. This class is a subclass of Thread class in Java, therefore the run() method
was overridden to initiate the movement of each swimmer. In the run() method, the movement of the
swimmer is configured by generating a random value according to the swimmer's rating (which is
given by the user) and summing them inside a loop. (Line – 74,76,83 in ThreadMovement Class)
This will make sure that the movement of each swimmer differ from one another. These threads are
initiated ( Thread.start() ) in the doBackStroke(), doBreastStroke() etc methods in the MaleSwimmer
and FemaleSwimmer classes.
So, whenever a new simulation begins multiple threads will start and creates a multi threaded
environment. However all the threads in this projects are mainly used configure the movement of the
swimmer, therefore even there are interruptions between the threads, it doesn't really break the
progress of the simulation. And the sleep time of the thread was minimized to around 40 milliseconds to maintain a smooth flow in GUI movement, otherwise sliders tend to show a lagging movement. (Line – 79 in ThreadMovement Class)
Other than setting the movement of swimmers, these threads in ThreadMovement Class updates the
status of the Judges and Spectators, displays and records the results, and updates the GUI in differentstages of their running time. (Line – 68,69,70 in ThreadMovent Class) Because run method is
declared as a synchronized method multiple threads cannot perform above functions simultaneously.
This useful in maintaining the flow and continuity of the GUI.</p>

<p><strong>Observer Observable Concept</strong></p>

<p>Observer Observable concept was used in this project to build the relation between Spectator and the
Score Board. In this project this relation was built manually without using in built the Observer and
Observable classes in Java.
In this scenario Observer is the Spectator and the Observable is the Score Board which notifies the
Observer when states changed. First a ArrayList of type Spectator (ArrayList) was
implemented inside the Class ScoreBoard. This is one of the fundamentals of this concept where
Observable should consist of a list of Observers. Usually there should be attach() and detach()
methods inside the Observable Class in order to maintain list of Observers, but in this case these
methods haven't been implemented because PeopleTrack Class already keeps track on every Spectator
created in the simulation. (Line – 16 in PeopleTrack class) Therefore that list of Spectators is
implemented inside the ScoreBoard class.
Then the notifySpectator(int i) method was implemented to update all the Spectators in the list (Line
– 45 in ScoreBoard Class) This integer parameter (i) is given by the running thread, and inside the
method this value is passed to the update(int i) method in Spectator Class. According to this value
Spectator changes its status (Line – 33 in Spectator Class) In order to Spectator objects to be updated
according the ScoreBoard states, notifySpectator(int i) method should constantly feed update(int i)
method with values given by the Thread. It is done in the ThreadMovement Class. (Line – 71,90 in
ThreadMovement Class)</p>
